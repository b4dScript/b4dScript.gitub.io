    I have gained professional experience working in networking companies and have a solid foundation in programming. Currently, I am focused on advancing my expertise in cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on penetration testing for businesses. Although I consider myself at a junior level, I have established a strong knowledge base that enables me to continue developing independently. I am currently pursuing the Penetration Tester Specialist certification through the Hack The Box Academy, and I am committed to continuous learning and growth in this dynamic field.
